# Typeing test game

A work in progress.
> 14-Nov-2019: Doing some updates. Would like to make the words move from left
to right across the screen. 
Current todo list (in no order):
- [ ] Move speedtest.[c|h] to screen.[c|h]
- [ ] Python app to make the word list 
- [ ] Word list. Easy, medium, hard
- [ ] Refactor screen functions
- [ ] Data structure for words on screen
- [ ] Way to update screen only when necessary
- [ ] Figure out location of game stats
- [ ] Save game? High score?

#### Reason
I wanted to make a game using low level terminal functions. This program is done
with out the help of _ncurses_ or other lib's. Just a fun test and nothing more.

#### Good resource
